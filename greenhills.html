          Located nine kilometers away from the national highway, Daligan Green-hills is every biking enthu-siast's dream. It boasts of a fully concreted road which connects the town to Sigay and Suyo. It is situated 284 kilometers above sea level which poses a chal-lenging slope for bikers and hikers alike, but all worth the effort because of the magnificent view from the top.
